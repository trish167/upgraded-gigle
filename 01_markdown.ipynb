    "## Introduction to Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce you to the basics of Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks. Later, you will use notebooks to create programs, but for now, we will focus on how to write text and format it using Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Markdown rather than, say, Microsoft Word, for many reasons. First, it is a simple text format, that is easy to read and write, and it can be converted to many other formats, such as HTML, PDF, and even Word. Second, as it is a text format, it is easy to detect changes between versions, and it fits well with being stored in version control, using systems like Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other reasons include that Markdown can be written in any text editor, so that we can use whatetever tools we like. Markdown is also very widely used in industry. And, finally, the format is not tied to any specific software vendor, so it is not likely to become obsolete in the near future."
